Founded in 1817 by the Dutch East Indies government, Kimia Farma is Indonesia's first pharmaceutical company. Initially named NV Chemicalien Handle Rathkamp & Co, it was nationalized in 1958 and renamed PNF Bhinneka Kimia Farma. The company transitioned to PT Kimia Farma (Persero) in 1971 and became a publicly listed company in 2001, establishing itself as an integrated healthcare provider contributing significantly to Indonesia's health sector.

In 2020, 90.025% of Kimia Farma's shares were transferred to PT Bio Farma (Persero), forming the State-Owned Pharmaceutical Holding. Along with this restructuring, the company’s name changed to PT Kimia Farma Tbk. With decades of experience, Kimia Farma continues to play a vital role in national health development.

## About Project
<p align="justify">
As Big Data Analytics Interns at Kimia Farma, our role involves tackling various challenges that demand a deep understanding of data and strong analytical skills. One of our key projects will be analyzing Kimia Farma's business performance from 2020 to 2023.
</p>

### Dataset 📊
In this project, we will receive 4 CSV tables.
- **kf_final_transaction.csv** : customer transaction details
- **kf_inventory.csv** : product inventory stocks
- **kf_kantor_cabang.csv** : branch store details
- **kf_product.csv** : product details

### Tools 🛠️
In this project, we will use several tools, including:
- **Google BigQuery**: for querying tables,
- **Google Looker Studio**: for creating visualization dashboards,
- **YouTube**: for video presentations,
- **GitHub**: for storing query files and results,
- **Microsoft PowerPoint**: for presentation files of our work
  
### Tasks 🎯
- In this project, you are tasked with importing the provided datasets (`Dataset.rar`) into tables in BigQuery. The table names should match the dataset names, but without the ".csv" extension.
- you are also required to create an analysis table based on aggregated results from the four previously imported tables. The following columns are mandatory for the analysis table:
  - `transaction_id`: transaction ID code,
  - `date`: the date the transaction occurred,
  - `branch_id`: Kimia Farma branch ID code,
  - `branch_name`: name of the Kimia Farma branch,
  - `kota`: city where the Kimia Farma branch is located,
  - `provinsi`: province where the Kimia Farma branch is located,
  - `rating_cabang`: customer rating for the Kimia Farma branch,
  - `customer_name`: name of the customer making the transaction,
  - `product_id`: code for the medicine product,
  - `product_name`: name of the medicine product,
  - `actual_price`: price of the medicine,
  - `discount_percentage`: discount percentage applied to the medicine,
  - `gross_profit_percentage`: gross profit percentage expected from the medicine based on the following conditions:
    - `Price` <= Rp 50,000 -> profit 10%
    - `Price` > Rp 50,000 - 100,000 -> profit 15%
    - `Price` > Rp 100,000 - 300,000 -> profit 20%
    - `Price` > Rp 300,000 - 500,000 -> profit 25%
    - `Price` > Rp 500,000 -> profit 30%,
   - `nett_sales`: price after the discount,
   - `nett_profit`: profit earned by Kimia Farma,
   - `rating_transaksi`: customer rating for the transaction.
- In this project, you are required to create a performance analysis dashboard for Kimia Farma from 2020-2023 in Google Looker Studio. This dashboard should be based on the analysis table you previously created in BigQuery, so you will need to connect that table to Google Looker Studio. You are free to design the dashboard according to your creativity, but it must include the following:
  - **Dashboard Title**
  - **Dashboard Summary**
  - **Filter Control**
  - **Data Snapshot**
  - **Comparison of Kimia Farma’s revenue year-over-year**
  - **Top 10 branches by total transactions in each province**
  - **Top 10 branches by net sales in each province**
  - **Top 5 branches with the highest ratings but lowest transaction ratings**
  - **Indonesia's Geo Map showing total profit by province**
  - **Additional analysis that you can explore**

### Results
#### BigQuery 📊
The `SQL and Result.rar` file contains the following SQL and CSV files:  
- **kf_analisa_suyanto.sql**: SQL syntax for the `analisa` table  
- **kf_analisa_suyanto.csv**: CSV file containing the result of the `kf_analisa_suyanto.sql` file  
- **kf_inventory_suyanto.sql**: SQL syntax for the `inventory` table  
- **kf_inventory_suyanto.csv**: CSV file containing the result of the `kf_inventory_suyanto.sql` file
